      "[GAMS](http://www.gams.com/) (the General Algebraic Modeling System) is generally cited as the first example of a commercially successful mathematical programming language. Since the introduction of GAMS in the late 1970's, a number of succesful languages have been produced including [AIMMS](http://business.aimms.com/), [AMPL](http://www.ampl.com/), [LINDO/LINGO](http://www.lindo.com/), [MPL](http://www.maximalsoftware.com/), [XPRESS-MOSEL](http://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization-suite/), and many others.  Of these, AMPL appears to be most widely adopted language for university training.\n",

      "[GNU MathProg](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLPK/GMPL_(MathProg)) is part of the open source [GNU GLPK project](http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/). MathProg offers a subset of the AMPL language roughly equivalent to AMPL as it distributed in the early 1990's and described in the [AMPL book](http://www.ampl.com/BOOK/download.html). Though distributed as part of GLPK, MathProg interfaces are available for other solvers including [lpsolve](http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/MathProg.htm) and COIN-OR CBC. MathProg can export models in a several formats compatiable with most commercial and non-commericial solvers for mixed-integer linear programs."
